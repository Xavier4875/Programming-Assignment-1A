Subject: Picking a topic for Project 1

In a previous Python class, I worked on a project with a partner where we developed a voting game application. It involved a GUI, and essentially you had a list of three candidates to choose from. Each candidate had his own profile page where you could view their positions and goals. On a separate screen, you could place your vote for any candidate, and you could do this as many times as you liked until you clicked on the "View Results" button, which would redirect you to a screen that listed the number of votes each candidate received along with their percentge of the entire vote share. At the bottom of the screen, the winner was listed. For my project, I would like to recreate this voting application in Java.
